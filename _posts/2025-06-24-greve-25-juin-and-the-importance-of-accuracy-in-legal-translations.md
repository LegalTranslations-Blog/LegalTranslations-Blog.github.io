On June 25, the greve 25 juin (June 25 strike) has drawn attention to the critical need for precise and reliable documentation, especially in the legal field. When legal professionals, notaries, and corporate teams in Belgium face disruptions, the accuracy, compliance, and confidentiality of legal document translation become even more vital. Whether you are preparing international contracts, notarial deeds, or official documents during periods of uncertainty, the stakes for error-free legal translations are exceptionally high.

## Why Accuracy Matters in Legal Translations

Legal documents carry significant legal weight—every clause, term, and condition must be translated with complete precision. An imprecise translation can lead to:

- Misinterpretations in international contracts, risking costly disputes or unenforceability
- Non-compliance with local Belgian regulations or EU law, jeopardizing legal standing
- Delays in notarial deeds or legalization processes, especially during events like greve 25 juin

Accuracy is not just a best practice; it is a legal necessity. Only certified legal translators with specialist expertise can ensure that your multilingual communication stands up to scrutiny, both in and out of court.

## Compliance and Confidentiality: The Foundation of Trust

Legal translations often involve sensitive or confidential information, from corporate agreements to personal records. Maintaining strict confidentiality is not optional—it is mandatory for protecting your client's interests and maintaining professional integrity.

Furthermore, compliance with Belgian and international standards—such as legalizations & apostilles—is essential. A trustworthy translation agency will guarantee that all documents meet the exacting requirements of courts, regulatory bodies, and public institutions.

## The Role of Sworn and Certified Legal Translators

Sworn translations are often required for official documents, such as birth certificates, contracts, and powers of attorney. In Belgium, only sworn translators can provide legally valid translations recognized by notaries, courts, and government agencies.

Certified legal translators not only ensure high-accuracy translations, but also provide essential error correction and review. This minimizes the risk of costly misinterpretations and ensures that your legal documentation is always reliable.

## Risks of Mistranslations in Legal Contexts

A single mistranslation in a contract or official document can:

- Expose your organization to legal risks
- Cause delays in cross-border transactions
- Undermine trust and reliability with clients and partners

Misinterpretations in international contracts can lead to disputes, lost revenue, and damage to your professional reputation. That is why quality over speed is essential in legal translation services.

## Choosing a Reliable Legal Translation Agency

Selecting the right partner for legal translations in Belgium means looking for:

- **Tailor-made solutions and a personal approach**: Every legal case is unique and deserves a customized translation strategy.
- **Proven expertise with official documents**: The agency should have a track record of handling notarial deeds, legalizations & apostilles, and complex contracts.
- **Commitment to confidentiality and compliance**: Trusted agencies safeguard your sensitive information and adhere to all regulatory requirements.
