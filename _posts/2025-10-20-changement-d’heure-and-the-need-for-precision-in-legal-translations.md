Twice annually, Belgium adjusts its clocks for the changement d’heure, a reminder of how even the smallest change in time can have far-reaching effects. In the legal profession, such nuances reflect the critical importance of precision, particularly in legal translations. For law firms, corporate legal departments, and public institutions, maintaining accuracy, compliance, and confidentiality in multilingual communication is not just best practice—it is essential to avoid legal risks.

## Why Legal Translations Demand Absolute Accuracy

Legal documents such as international contracts, notarial deeds, and official documents are governed by strict regulations. A single mistranslation can result in misinterpretations, delayed proceedings, or even costly legal disputes. When legal texts are translated, every term, date, and clause must be rendered faithfully. Unlike everyday translation, legal translations require an in-depth understanding of legal terminology and the implications of each word across different jurisdictions.

### Risks of Misinterpretation During Changement d’heure

The changement d’heure can impact deadlines, contract execution times, and the enforceability of time-sensitive legal documents. An incorrect translation of time-related clauses or failure to account for local time changes can lead to significant compliance issues or disputes. This is why sworn translations and certified legal translators are indispensable in cross-border legal matters.

## The Role of Sworn and Certified Translators

Sworn translations are performed by translators authorized by a competent authority, ensuring the translation is legally recognized in Belgium and abroad. Certified legal translators not only possess linguistic expertise but also have specialized legal knowledge to translate complex documents like:

- International contracts
- Notarial deeds
- Legalizations and apostilles
- Court judgments
- Compliance documentation

These professionals guarantee that translations hold up under legal scrutiny, reducing the risk of error correction or litigation due to misinterpretation.

## Confidentiality and Compliance: Non-Negotiables in Legal Translations

Legal translations often involve sensitive information. Trust and reliability are fundamental when selecting a translation agency. Confidentiality agreements and secure processes must be in place to protect client data. Compliance with Belgian and international legal standards ensures that all translated documents are valid, enforceable, and error-free.

## Choosing the Right Legal Translation Agency

When seeking translation services for legal documents, prioritize agencies with:

- **Certified legal translators** experienced in Belgian and international law
- Proven expertise in sworn translations and notarial deeds
- Robust processes for proofreading and review to guarantee error correction
- A reputation for prioritizing quality over speed
- Tailor-made solutions and a personal approach for unique legal challenges

A reliable agency will provide translations without legal risks and support clients through complex multilingual communication needs.
