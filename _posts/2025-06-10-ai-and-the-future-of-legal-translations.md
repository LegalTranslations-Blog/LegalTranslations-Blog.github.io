In recent years, the influence of AI on multilingual communication has become undeniable. For law firms, corporate legal departments, and public institutions across Belgium, the prospect of using AI for legal translations promises efficiency. Yet, accuracy, compliance, and confidentiality remain paramount—especially when translating official documents, international contracts, and notarial deeds.

## Why Accuracy Matters In Legal Translations

Legal documents carry binding obligations. A single misinterpretation in international contracts or errors in notarial deeds can lead to costly disputes, compliance failures, or even loss of trust. While AI tools can assist in initial drafts or terminology searches, they often lack the nuanced understanding of legal terminology and local context required for sworn translations.

- **Official documents** must be translated with precision to be valid in court or with government agencies.
- **Legalizations & apostilles** require certified legal translators who understand both the source and target legal systems.
- **Error correction and proofreading** are essential to avoid any misinterpretations in international contracts.

## The Role Of Sworn And Certified Legal Translators

Sworn translations, performed by certified professionals, are legally recognized and accepted by Belgian courts and authorities. These translators have been vetted for their expertise and are bound by confidentiality and ethical standards. Their work goes beyond simple word-for-word translation—they ensure every nuance, clause, and stipulation is accurately rendered.

AI can support these experts with translation memory and consistency checks, but human oversight remains irreplaceable for:

- Reviewing contracts for cultural or jurisdictional nuances
- Ensuring that legal terms are not lost in translation
- Providing tailor-made solutions and a personal approach

## Risks Of Mistranslation In Legal Contexts

Misinterpretations in international contracts or inaccuracies in official documents can expose law firms and businesses to significant legal risks. Incorrect translations may invalidate agreements, lead to regulatory breaches, or compromise compliance. AI-driven translations, without expert review, may miss subtle legal distinctions, putting your organisation at risk.

## Choosing A Reliable Legal Translation Agency

When selecting a translation agency, prioritise trust and reliability over speed. Look for:

- **Proven experience** with legal translations in Belgium
- **Certified legal translators** for sworn translations and legalizations
- **Quality assurance processes** for error correction and review
- **Commitment to confidentiality** and data protection

However, the future belongs to agencies that balance technological innovation with human expertise—delivering high-accuracy, certified legal translations that meet the highest standards of compliance and confidentiality.
