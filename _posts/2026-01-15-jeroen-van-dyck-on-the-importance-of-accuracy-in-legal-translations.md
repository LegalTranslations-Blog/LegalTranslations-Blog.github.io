Legal professionals across Belgium know that when it comes to official documents, accuracy isn’t just desirable—it’s essential. Whether you’re handling international contracts, notarial deeds, or compliance paperwork, a single misinterpretation can lead to costly legal risks. Jeroen Van Dyck’s approach underscores why certified, high-accuracy legal translations are the foundation of trust and reliability in multilingual communication.

## Why Accuracy Matters in Legal Document Translation

Legal translations are not like translating general business content or marketing materials. Each legal term, clause, and statement carries weight—sometimes with binding consequences. Inaccurate or ambiguous language in international contracts or official documents can cause:

- **Contract disputes** due to mistranslations or unclear terms  
- **Compliance failures** if regulatory nuances are lost in translation  
- **Legalizations & apostilles delays** when documents are not translated according to official standards  
- **Risk of misinterpretations** that can undermine notarial deeds and other legally binding texts

For law firms, corporate legal departments, and public institutions, the stakes are simply too high to settle for anything less than expert legal translation services.

## The Role of Sworn and Certified Legal Translators

Every document destined for courts, government agencies, or cross-border agreements needs more than language proficiency. It requires sworn translators—experts authorized to provide certified legal translations that hold up under legal scrutiny.

**Key reasons to rely on sworn and certified legal translators:**  
- **Legal validity:** Sworn translations are officially recognized for use in Belgium and abroad  
- **Confidentiality:** Certified legal translators adhere to strict codes of conduct, ensuring sensitive information remains protected  
- **Error correction and review:** Professional agencies offer advanced proofreading and review, minimizing misinterpretations in international contracts  
- **Tailor-made solutions:** Every translation is customized to the specific legal context and jurisdiction

## Avoiding Legal Risks Through Quality and Compliance

Choosing quality over speed is not just a matter of preference—it's a safeguard against preventable legal risks. Misinterpretations, omissions, or even small errors can have serious implications, from financial losses to reputational damage.

**Risks associated with poor legal translations:**  
- Invalid or unenforceable contracts  
- Delayed business operations due to rejected documents  
- Compliance penalties for inaccurate filings  
- Exposure of confidential data

Working with a specialized translation agency like LegalTranslations ensures that every document undergoes rigorous proofreading and review, following a translation strategy that prioritizes accuracy, compliance, and confidentiality.

- **Certified track record:** Confirm that translators are sworn and certified  
- **Sector specialization:** Look for agencies with proven experience in legal translations  
- **Personal approach:** Opt for a team that offers tailor-made solutions and understands your unique requirements  
- **Transparent processes:** Ask about their proofreading, error correction, and document legalization procedures  
- **Commitment to confidentiality:** Ensure robust safeguards for sensitive information
