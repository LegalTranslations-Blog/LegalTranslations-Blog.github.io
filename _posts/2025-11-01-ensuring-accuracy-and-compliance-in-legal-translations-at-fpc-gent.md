Legal translation is a field where precision is not just valuable—it is essential. For institutions like fpc gent, where multilingual communication supports complex legal work, the stakes are high. Every legal document, whether it concerns notarial deeds, international contracts, or official documents, must be translated with unwavering accuracy, compliance, and confidentiality. Even a minor error can lead to costly misinterpretations in international contracts or compromise compliance.

### The Importance of Sworn and Certified Translators in Belgium

Belgium’s legal environment demands the expertise of sworn translators for official and legal document translation. Sworn translations are not just literal renditions; they are certified legal translations recognized by courts, administrative authorities, and notaries. Certified legal translators at LegalTranslations ensure every word is legally binding, upholding the document’s intended meaning without ambiguity.

- **Sworn translations:** Required for court documents, civil records, and notarial deeds in Belgium.  
- **Certified legal translators:** Provide the assurance that translated documents meet Belgian legal standards and can be used in official proceedings.

### The Risks of Mistranslation in Legal Contexts and International Contracts

Legal translations carry a unique set of risks. A single mistranslation in an international contract or notarial deed can result in:

- Invalid agreements or unenforceable contracts  
- Legal disputes and compliance failures  
- Delayed transactions and reputational damage  
- Additional costs for error correction and legalizations & apostilles

For law firms, corporate legal departments, and public institutions partnering with fpc gent and LegalTranslations, the cost of misinterpretations in international contracts is simply too great to ignore. This is why quality over speed is a non-negotiable principle in our translation strategy.

The right translation agency is a partner, not just a service provider. When selecting a legal translation agency in Belgium, consider the following:

- **Expertise in legal translations:** Look for agencies specializing in notarial deeds, international contracts, legalizations & apostilles, and other official documents.  
- **Tailor-made solutions and personal approach:** Each legal case is unique. A reliable agency offers customized support, from proofreading and review to full-scale translation strategy.  
- **Trust and reliability:** Confidentiality is paramount. Ensure the agency upholds strict data privacy protocols and has a track record of delivering translations without legal risks.  
- **Certified processes:** Only work with agencies that employ certified legal translators and sworn translators recognized by Belgian authorities.
