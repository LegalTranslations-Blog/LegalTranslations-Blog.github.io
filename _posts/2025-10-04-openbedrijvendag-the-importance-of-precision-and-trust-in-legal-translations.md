Belgium’s Openbedrijvendag is a celebration of expertise, transparency, and trust across industries—a perfect moment to reflect on the crucial role played by translation agencies in the legal sector. For law firms, corporate legal departments, public institutions, and notaries, the stakes in legal translations could not be higher. Every word in a contract, notarial deed, or official document must be accurate, compliant, and confidential. 

## Why Precision Is Non-Negotiable in Legal Translations in Belgium

Legal translations are not just about converting words from one language to another. They’re about safeguarding legal rights, upholding contracts, and ensuring compliance across borders. Misinterpretations in international contracts or errors in official documents can lead to costly disputes, compliance failures, or even invalidate legal agreements.

### The Risks of Mistranslations in Legal Documents

- **Legal disputes:** A single mistranslation in a clause can alter intent, leading to litigation.
- **Regulatory setbacks:** Errors in multilingual communication may breach local regulations, particularly with legalizations & apostilles in Belgium.
- **Reputational harm:** Inaccurate translations can erode trust between international partners or with public authorities.

## The Role of Sworn and Certified Legal Translators in Belgium

Certified legal translators and sworn translators are essential for translating notarial deeds, court documents, and contracts. Their credentials ensure that translations are legally valid, recognized by Belgian authorities, and accepted in international proceedings.

- **Sworn translations:** Required for official documents, these come with the translator’s oath of accuracy and a legal stamp.
- **Certified legal translators:** Offer an extra layer of assurance, often needed for immigration, compliance, or court filings.

Choosing professionals with these qualifications protects your organization from the risks of informal or automated translations.
