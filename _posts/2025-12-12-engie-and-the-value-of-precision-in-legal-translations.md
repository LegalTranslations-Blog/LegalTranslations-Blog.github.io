Legal translations are at the core of successful international business, cross-border litigation, and compliance in Belgium. Companies like Engie, operating across jurisdictions, cannot afford ambiguity or errors in their official documents, contracts, or compliance filings. For legal professionals, notaries, and corporate legal departments, the choice of a trusted translation agency is fundamental to safeguarding their interests and upholding the law.

## Why Accuracy and Compliance Matter in Legal Translations in Belgium

Legal documents—including notarial deeds, international contracts, and official documents—carry significant weight. A single misinterpretation or mistranslation can lead to:

- Costly litigation  
- Regulatory penalties  
- Invalidated agreements  
- Lost business opportunities

Accurate legal translations are essential not only for clear communication but also for ensuring that documents retain their legal force across languages and jurisdictions. In Belgium’s multilingual legal environment, this is non-negotiable.

## The Crucial Role of Sworn and Certified Translators in Belgian Legal Translation Services

Sworn translations and certified legal translators are the backbone of reliable legal translation services. Their qualifications and official recognition mean:

- Translations are accepted by Belgian courts, government agencies, and international authorities  
- Every word is certified as true to the original, maintaining legal validity  
- Sensitive information is handled with strict confidentiality

Certified translators also navigate complex requirements for legalizations and apostilles, ensuring international documents are recognized without legal risks.

## The Hidden Risks of Mistranslations in International Contracts and Notarial Deeds

Misinterpretations in international contracts or errors in notarial deeds can have severe consequences:

- Contract disputes arising from ambiguous terms  
- Delayed transactions due to non-compliant translations  
- Reputational damage for law firms and corporate legal departments

Error correction and rigorous proofreading and review processes are essential components of a robust translation strategy. A professional translation agency prioritizes quality over speed, offering tailor-made solutions and a personal approach for each client.
