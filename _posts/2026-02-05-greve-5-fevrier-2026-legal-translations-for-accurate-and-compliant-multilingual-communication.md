On 5 February 2026, the anticipated greve (strike) across Belgium is set to impact numerous sectors, including legal services and international business. For law firms, corporate legal departments, and public institutions, the need for precise, timely, and confidential legal communication becomes even more critical during such pivotal periods. Effective multilingual communication—especially when it involves legal translations of official documents, notarial deeds, and international contracts—can mean the difference between compliance and costly legal risks.

## Why Accuracy Is Paramount in Legal Translations

Legal documents are binding. Whether it's a notarial deed, contract, or an official document requiring legalization or an apostille, every word must be translated with absolute precision. Even minor misinterpretations in international contracts can result in disputes, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Key risks of inaccurate legal translations:**
- Misinterpretations that could alter the terms of international contracts
- Non-compliance with Belgian or EU legal requirements
- Increased exposure to legal risks and liabilities
- Delays in cross-border transactions due to error correction or document rejection

High-accuracy translations by certified legal translators ensure your documentation stands up in court and meets all regulatory standards.

## The Crucial Role of Sworn and Certified Translators

Sworn translations—provided by translators authorized and recognized by the Belgian courts—are often mandatory for official documents, court submissions, and notarial deeds. Certified legal translators bring essential expertise in both legal terminology and multilingual communication, guaranteeing that translated documents carry the same legal weight as the originals.

**Why choose sworn and certified translators?**
- Guarantee of accuracy and official recognition
- Familiarity with legal standards in Belgium and internationally
- Protection against misinterpretations and costly legal disputes
- Confidence for law firms, notaries, and compliance officers handling sensitive documents

## Confidentiality and Compliance: Essential for Legal Translation Services

Legal translations frequently involve sensitive information. Maintaining strict confidentiality is not just best practice—it's a legal and ethical necessity. A reputable translation agency implements robust data protection and privacy protocols to safeguard client interests.

Moreover, compliance with Belgian law and international standards ensures that translated documents are accepted by courts, public authorities, and counterparties abroad.

**Choose an agency that offers:**
- Secure data handling and storage
- Experienced certified legal translators
- Understanding of Belgian and EU legal systems
- Tailor-made solutions and a personal approach
