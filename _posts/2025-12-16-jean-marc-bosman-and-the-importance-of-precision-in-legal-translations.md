When Jean Marc Bosman challenged football’s transfer rules, the outcome changed not just sports contracts, but the legal landscape across Europe. His case stands as a striking example of how international contracts, official documents, and multilingual communication can impact lives, businesses, and institutions. In these high-stakes matters, accuracy, compliance, and confidentiality in legal translations are not just formalities—they are non-negotiable essentials.

## Why Legal Translations Demand More Than Words

Legal documents—whether notarial deeds, international contracts, or regulatory filings—require more than literal translation. Every phrase carries legal weight. Misinterpretations in international contracts or official documents can lead to disputes, financial losses, and even court cases. For law firms, corporate legal departments, and public institutions in Belgium, the margin for error is virtually zero.

### Risks of Mistranslation in Legal Contexts

- **Contractual disputes:** A single ambiguity in a translated contract can open the door to costly litigation.
- **Compliance failures:** Misunderstood regulations can result in non-compliance, regulatory penalties, or invalidation of documents.
- **Loss of trust:** For notaries, immigration lawyers, and government agencies, mistakes can damage professional reputations and undermine public confidence.

## The Role of Sworn and Certified Translators

Certified legal translators and sworn translators play a pivotal role in safeguarding the integrity of legal documents. Their work goes beyond language fluency—they possess deep knowledge of legal terminology, local laws, and the nuances of multilingual communication. Sworn translations and certified legal translators ensure that translations are both accurate and recognized by courts, notaries, and public authorities.
