On 18 September, the greves transports (transport strikes) captured the attention of legal professionals and businesses across Belgium. In times of disruption, whether logistical or legal, the accuracy and reliability of official documents become even more critical. For law firms, corporate legal departments, and public institutions managing international contracts or notarial deeds, the stakes in multilingual communication are high. One misinterpreted clause or unclear legalization can lead to costly delays, especially during events like the greves transports 18 septembre.

## Why Accuracy Matters in Legal Translations

Legal translations require more than word-for-word conversion. Every term, phrase, and nuance must precisely reflect the original intent, ensuring that contracts, notarial deeds, and official documents hold up in court or under regulatory scrutiny. Inaccurate translations can result in:

- **Misinterpretations in international contracts**
- **Invalid notarial deeds**
- **Breach of compliance regulations**
- **Legal risks and financial losses**

During high-pressure situations such as the greves transports 18 septembre, when timelines are tight and stakes are elevated, the need for error-free, sworn translations becomes paramount. Quality over speed is not just a preference—it is a necessity to avoid misunderstandings that could have legal repercussions.

## The Role of Sworn and Certified Legal Translators

Sworn translations, performed by certified legal translators, are often required for official documents such as court filings, immigration papers, and cross-border agreements. These professionals are authorized to attest that a translation is true and complete, making it legally valid for submission to authorities in Belgium and abroad.

### Key Benefits of Working with Sworn Translators:

- **Certainty of compliance:** Documents meet local and international legal requirements.
- **Confidentiality:** Sensitive information remains secure throughout the translation process.
- **Error correction and review:** Rigorous proofreading and review prevent costly mistakes.

Without the expertise of a certified legal translator, organizations risk miscommunications that could compromise contracts or cause delays—especially when events like the greves transports 18 septembre disrupt regular workflows.

## Avoiding Legal Risks: The Dangers of Mistranslation

Legalizations, apostilles, and notarizations require precise terminology. Even a minor error can lead to the rejection of documents or invalidate agreements. For instance, a mistranslation in a clause about liability in an international contract can shift financial responsibility and expose a business to unforeseen risks.

To safeguard your organization:

- **Invest in a translation agency with a proven track record in legal translations**
- **Prioritize tailor-made solutions and a personal approach**
- **Choose a partner that values trust and reliability**
